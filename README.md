This assignment involves implementing and comparing various search algorithms for solving the Snake Puzzle. The goal is to evaluate the performance of A*, Greedy Best First search, and at least one other search algorithm on different maps with walls. The task allows you to work in groups of up to three, where each member takes responsibility for implementing and documenting one of the search strategies.

Objectives:
Implement three search agents, including A* and Greedy Best First search.
Compare the agentsâ€™ performance on different puzzle maps.
Document the implementation and experimental results in a report.
